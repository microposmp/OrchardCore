# Orchard Core 3.0.0

Release date: Not yet released

Before upgrading from version 2 to v3, it is important to first compile your project using the latest available v2 version, resolve any warnings, and then proceed with the upgrade to v3.

## Breaking Changes

### GraphQL Module

#### GraphQL Library Upgrade

The `GraphQL` libraries have been upgraded from version 7 to version 8. Below are important changes and considerations for your implementation:

1. **Removal of Default Implementation**:  
   The `IContentTypeBuilder` interface previously included a default implementation for the `Clear()` method. This implementation has been removed. If you have a custom implementation of `IContentTypeBuilder`, you must now provide your own `Clear()` method. The method can remain empty if no specific actions are needed.

2. **Sealed Classes**:  
   Several classes have been marked as sealed to prevent further inheritance. This change is intended to enhance stability and maintainability. The following classes are now sealed:

   - All implementations of `InputObjectGraphType`
   - All implementations of `ObjectGraphType<>`
   - All implementations of `WhereInputObjectGraphType`
   - All implementations of `DynamicContentTypeBuilder`
   - All implementations of `IContentTypeBuilder`
   - All implementations of `GraphQLFilter`
   - All implementations of `ISchemaBuilder`
   
### Elasticsearch Module

#### Deprecation of the NEST Library

We previously relied on the [NEST](https://www.nuget.org/packages/NEST) library to interface with the Elasticsearch service. However, due to the deprecation of NEST, we have migrated to its successor, [Elastic.Clients.Elasticsearch](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Elastic.Clients.Elasticsearch). As part of this transition, the following interfaces and classes have been removed:

- `IElasticAnalyzer`
- `IElasticSearchQueryService` (use `ElasticsearchQueryService` as an alternative)
- `ElasticAnalyzer`

To ensure consistency across our codebase, all classes and interfaces are now prefixed with `Elasticsearch` instead of `Elastic` or `ElasticSearch`. The only exception to this naming convention is for settings, which have been retained to minimize further breaking changes.

Additionally, the `OrchardCore.Search.Elasticsearch.Abstractions` project has been removed, and the following classes have been relocated to the `OrchardCore.Search.Elasticsearch.Core` project:

- `ElasticsearchOptions`
- `ElasticsearchQueryResults`
- `ElasticsearchTopDocs`

The method `ExecuteQueryAsync(string indexName, Query query, List<SortOptions> sort, int from, int size)` has been removed from the `ElasticsearchQueryService` class. In its place, we have introduced the new method `GetContentItemIdsAsync(ElasticsearchSearchContext request)`, which streamlines the query execution process by encapsulating the necessary parameters within a single context object.

### Users Module

The user registration and login functionalities have been refactored for better extensibility:

- **Registration Improvements**:  
  - The `IRegistrationFormEvents` interface now includes `Task RegisteringAsync(UserRegisteringContext context)` for streamlined customization.  
  - A new base class, `RegistrationFormEventsBase`, allows developers to override only necessary methods.

- **Login Improvements**:  
  - The `ILoginFormEvent` interface has a new method: `Task<IActionResult> ValidatingLoginAsync(IUser user)`.  
  - The `LoginFormEventBase` class enables overriding relevant methods. Note that the base implementation of `LoggingInAsync()` has been removed; you must now implement this method if using `LoginFormEventBase`.

- **User Service Update**:  
  - A new method in `IUserService` interface: `Task<IUser> RegisterAsync(RegisterUserForm model, Action<string, string> reportError)` facilitates registration with error reporting.

These enhancements make the user management system more modular and customizable.

#### Removed old settings

The following obsolete settings were removed from `RegistrationSettings` class

- `NoPasswordForExternalUsers`
- `NoUsernameForExternalUsers`
- `NoEmailForExternalUsers`
- `UseScriptToGenerateUsername`
- `GenerateUsernameScript`
- `UsersCanRegister`

The following obsolete settings were removed from `LoginSettings` class

- `UseExternalProviderIfOnlyOneDefined`
- `UseScriptToSyncRoles`
- `SyncRolesScript`

#### Login View Update

The `ExternalLogin` action has been removed from the `Account` controller. If you are using a custom `Login.cshtml` view or `Login` template, please update the external login form action. As of this update, the `ExternalLogin` action has been relocated to the `ExternalAuthentications` controller.

#### AssignRoleToUsers Permission Update

The `AssignRoleToUsers` permission is no longer implicitly granted by `EditUsers`. To maintain the same behavior, make sure to explicitly assign the `AssignRoleToUsers` permission to any role that already has the `EditUsers` permission.

#### The Behavior of 'has_claim' Liquid Filter Changed.

The `Administrator` role no longer registers permission-based claims by default during login. This means that directly checking for specific claims in Liquid, such as:

```liquid
{% assign isAuthorized = User | has_claim: "Permission", "AccessAdminPanel" %}
```

will return `false` for administrators, even though they still have full access. Non-admin users, however, may return `true` if they have the claim.  It's important to use the `has_permission` filter for permission checks going forward:

```liquid
{% assign isAuthorized = User | has_permission: "AccessAdminPanel" %}
```

### ReCaptcha

In the previous implementation, the ReCaptcha module supported two modes: `AlwaysShow` and `PreventRobots`. To simplify the module and enhance integration, the `PreventRobots` mode and its related components have been removed. Going forward, **only the `AlwaysShow` mode** will be supported.

As part of this update, the following components have been deprecated and removed:

- `IDetectRobots`
- `IPAddressRobotDetector`
- `ReCaptchaMode`

Furthermore, the `ReCaptchaService` class has been sealed to prevent inheritance. The following methods have also been removed:

- `MaybeThisIsARobot`
- `IsThisARobot`
- `ThisIsAHuman`

Previously, the `FormReCaptcha` view was available to inject a ReCaptcha challenge from any display driver. This view has been removed. The recommended approach now is to return a shape directly, as shown below:

```csharp
return Dynamic("ReCaptcha", (m) =>
{
    m.language = CultureInfo.CurrentUICulture.Name;
}).Location("Content:after");
```

Instead of using this approach:

```csharp
return View("FormReCaptcha", model).Location("Content:after");
```

If you still need to render ReCaptcha using the deprecated `FormReCaptcha`, you can manually add the `FormReCaptcha.cshtml` view to your project. Here's the code for this:

```html
<div class="mb-3">
    <captcha mode="AlwaysShow" language="@Orchard.CultureName()" />
</div>
``` 

This change is designed to simplify your integration process and make it easier to manage ReCaptcha usage in your project.

## Change Log

### Roles Module

#### Permission Behavior Added to Roles Recipe Step

The `Roles` recipe now includes the ability to define specific permission behaviors, allowing you to control how permissions are managed within a role. The following behaviors are available:

- **Replace**: This behavior removes all existing permissions associated with the role and replaces them with the new permissions from the `Permissions` collection. This is the default behavior.
- **Add**: This behavior adds the new permission(s) from the `Permissions` collection to the role, but only if they do not already exist. It does not affect the existing permissions.
- **Remove**: This behavior removes the specified permission(s) in the `Permissions` collection from the roleâ€™s existing permissions.

For more info about the new `PermissionBehavior`, check out the [documentation](../reference/modules/Roles/README.md).
 
### ReCaptcha

#### New ReCaptcha Shape

A new `ReCaptcha` shape has been introduced, enabling you to render the ReCaptcha challenge using a customizable shape. For more details, please refer to the [documentation](../reference/modules/ReCaptcha/README.md).

## Miscellaneous

### Sealing Types

Many type commonly used by classes can be `sealed`, which improves runtime performance. While it's not mandatory, we recommend that you consider applying this improvement to your own extensions as well. We've implemented this enhancement in pull request [#16897](https://github.com/OrchardCMS/OrchardCore/pull/16897).

### New Extension Method for Adding `IConfigureOptions<ResourceManagementOptions>` Implementations

When adding an `IConfigureOptions<ResourceManagementOptions>` implementation, used to add static resources and commonly named `ResourceManagementOptionsConfiguration`, you previously had to do the following in the `Startup` classes:

```csharp
services.AddTransient<IConfigureOptions<ResourceManagementOptions>, ResourceManagementOptionsConfiguration>();
```

To simplify this, we introduced a new extension method to do the same in a shorter form:

```csharp
services.AddResourceConfiguration<ResourceManagementOptionsConfiguration>();
```

You can utilize this in your codebase by searching the `AddTransient<IConfigureOptions<ResourceManagementOptions>, (.+)>\(\)` regex pattern and replacing it with `AddResourceConfiguration<$1>()`. Projects using this have to reference the `OrchardCore.ResourceManagement` package.
